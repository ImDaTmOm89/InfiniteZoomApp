# PROGRESS.md

Last updated: 2026-10-19 (audit, after PLAN.md restored)

## Known issues

- `PLAN.md` restored this session; the uncommitted work maps to Steps 7-17.
- No project-picker UI found calling `ProjectStorage.listProjects()` — either still
  missing or part of a later Menu item not yet wired.
- `PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `.vscode/settings.json` are all uncommitted.

## Finished steps

- Steps 1–2 — committed (`f80b1b5 Steps 1-2 working`).
- Step 3 — Data models: `model/Models.kt` (BrushType = PEN, MARKER, AIRBRUSH).
- Step 4 — Zoom engine: `engine/InfiniteZoomEngine.kt` verified against the plan
  (descend/ascend math, thresholds 100/0.5, CHILD_REACH 500). `EngineTest` re-run
  with `--rerun-tasks` passes (testZoomIn + testZoomOut).
- Step 5 — Navigation view: `input/DrawingView.kt`, `render/CanvasRenderer.kt` verified
  against the plan (stylus draws / fingers navigate / palm rejection / cancel on second
  finger when fingerDraws). Note: DrawingView also sets `vm.eraserMode` from
  `TOOL_TYPE_ERASER`, which belongs to Step 8 — the file is shared between steps.
- Step 6 — Strokes with ribbon `drawStroke` — committed (`03d7906 Step 6 verified`).
  Re-verified this session: ViewModel stroke lifecycle matches plan (local coords,
  1.5/zoom min-distance filter, width in level-local units, recentColors max 8,
  in-progress stroke drawn as temp Stroke with BrushType.PEN).
- Step 7 — `renderWorld` level-tree rendering verified in CanvasRenderer.kt
  (ancestors underneath, current + descendants on top, exclude-subtree, sub-pixel
  culling at cz < 0.02, debug text retained). Uncommitted diff. Re-verified:
  `render` = drawPaper → renderWorld → drawInProgress; `drawPaper` pattern repeat
  clamps screen pitch to 20-160 px (sp /= 5 / sp *= 5); layer blend modes NORMAL /
  MULTIPLY / SCREEN / OVERLAY / DARKEN / LIGHTEN via PorterDuffXfermode.
- Step 8 — Brush/Tool variants (marker alpha, airbrush blur, eraser) in ViewModel/renderer.
- Step 9 — Undo/redo system moved to `engine/Commands.kt` (untracked); `model/Commands.kt`
  deleted in working tree.
- Step 10 — Layer logic & rendering (opacity/blend/lock) wired into ViewModel/renderer.
- Step 11 — Compose UI shell overlays in `MainActivity.kt`.
- Steps 12–15 — panels: ColorPickerPanel, BrushSettingsPanel, LayersPanel, PaperPanel.
- Step 16 — Persistence: `storage/ProjectStorage.kt` (untracked), autosave debounce,
  restore-last-project, save on ON_PAUSE/dispose.

## Step in progress

- Step 18 — final checklist / commit of all Steps 7–17 work. Evidence: git shows
  modified MainActivity.kt, CanvasRenderer.kt, DrawingViewModel.kt;
  deleted model/Commands.kt; untracked engine/Commands.kt, storage/ProjectStorage.kt.
  Nothing from Step 7 onward is committed yet.

## Verification (this audit)

- `gradlew assembleDebug` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (EngineTest passes)
- `BrushType` = PEN, MARKER, AIRBRUSH ✔
- `drawStroke` = ribbon version ✔ (no fix applied)
